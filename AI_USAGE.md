# AI Usage Notes

### Initial Ideation & Prototyping

I mainly used v0 and Lovable to ideate an initial version of the application. I already had in mind that I wanted to create something with the Gemini 2.5 image model, and this project gave me a reason to create something I could use myself.

After going through the requirements, I used a PRD created from Gemini to ideate two application versions with v0 and Lovable. Both of them worked great.

Here are the two initial versions:

|                        v0 Prototype                        |                          Lovable Prototype                           |

### Design Inspiration & Refinement

I needed some inspiration for the design. I've always been a fan of minimalism and Apple's design philosophy and I have been following Playground AI for a long time, so I thought I could take inspiration from their UI.

Using this as a foundation, I used Figma to adjust some elements to create the look I wanted. This helped me organize my code and know where to take the design to complete the project.

### Development & Asset Creation

- **Coding Assistant:** Later, I mainly used **Cursor** and **AI Studio (Gemini)** as a coding assistant.
- **Artwork Generation:** I had very little time to create custom artwork, so I used the **Gemini 2.5 image model** to create images for the style picker (where users can select tasks like change background, change color, restyle, etc.).

### AI Usage Screenshot

I respected the instructions, and since it mentioned that 6-8 hours is the hard stop, I stopped at the 8-hour mark to write this document. I still need to create the video and write the email to you guys. :)

And here is a little evidence. It's an image of my Gemini chat history which shows I first started to chat with it about 8 hours ago.
